ðŸ§¾ Expense Tracker â€” Tkinter | SQLite | Matplotlib
This is a simple and user-friendly Expense Tracker desktop app built using Python. The project was developed during my internship at Sami Infotech, offered through the AICTE internship program.

The tracker allows users to easily add, view, and delete expenses, categorize them, and track them by date. It also offers a pie chart visualization to give a clear snapshot of where the money is going. The app uses Tkinter for the graphical interface, SQLite for backend storage, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

ðŸ”‘ Features:
Add expenses with category, amount, and date

View all expenses in a table with real-time updates

Delete one or multiple expenses using unique ID-based tracking

Display total spending

Show pie chart for category-wise spending analysis

User-friendly design, responsive on desktop and laptop

ðŸ“š Tech Stack:
Python

Tkinter (GUI)

SQLite (Database)

Matplotlib (Graphs/Visualization)

ðŸš€ What I Learned:
Building full-stack desktop apps with Python

Designing intuitive user interfaces with Tkinter

Integrating SQLite for persistent data storage

Handling user input and exceptions efficiently

Using Matplotlib to visualize real-time data

This project served as a great learning experience in building real-world applications with clean design and strong functionality.
